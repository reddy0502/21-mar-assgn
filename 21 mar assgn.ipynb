    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques for converting categorical data into numerical data. However, there are some important differences between these two techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Ordinal encoding assigns a numerical value to each category based on its order or rank, while label encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category without considering any order or rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: Ordinal encoding is typically used when there is a natural order or ranking among the categories, such as in the case of ratings (e.g., 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars) or education levels (e.g., high school, college, graduate school). Label encoding is typically used when there is no inherent order or ranking among the categories, such as in the case of colors or zip codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact on model performance: The choice of encoding technique can have an impact on the performance of machine learning models. Ordinal encoding may introduce a false sense of order among the categories, which may not reflect the true relationship between the categories. Label encoding, on the other hand, does not consider any order or ranking among the categories and may treat them equally, which may not be appropriate in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a dataset containing information about different types of products, including their color and price range. The color feature has no inherent order or ranking, so we might choose to use label encoding to convert it into numerical data. The price range feature, however, has a natural order, such as low, medium, and high. In this case, we might choose to use ordinal encoding to convert it into numerical data based on the order of the categories"

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique for encoding categorical variables that considers the relationship between the category and the target variable. This encoding method replaces the categories of a categorical variable with ordinal numbers based on the mean of the target variable for each category. The categories with a higher mean are assigned higher ordinal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset that contains information about different types of cars, including their make (categorical variable) and their selling price (target variable). We want to use the make variable to predict the selling price. The make variable has five categories: Toyota, Honda, Ford, Chevrolet, and Nissan."

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the degree to which two random variables in a dataset are linearly related. It measures how much two variables vary together, or in other words, how much they tend to move in the same direction. A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to move in opposite directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it helps to understand the relationship between two variables in a dataset. It is used to determine whether two variables are positively or negatively related and the strength of that relationship. Covariance is also useful in identifying patterns in data, and it is commonly used in machine learning algorithms to select features that are most strongly related to the target variable.\n",
